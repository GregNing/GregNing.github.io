#### Resizing the file is the same process as making a swap file. So, you have three options:
1. Add another swapfile. 2 files of 2GB is the same as one of 4GB (ie 4GB swap)
2. Delete this file. and make a new one that is 4GB
3. Reuse this file.

=======================================
<br>

#### To make new or reuse your current file, you have to type:

<br>

```bash
  sudo swapoff -a   # turn off all swap
  sudo rm /swapfile # this step is if you want to delete the current file
  sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096 #makes a 4GB file
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile #set permission to root only if you made a new file
  sudo mkswap /swapfile #converts file to swap format
  sudo swapon /swapfile #enable swap on the file.
```

#### 寫到 fstab 開機自動掛載 swapfile 重開時會自動swap file

```bash
root@cite-web01:/# echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
=> /swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```
